# Minesweeper

Leveraged Android Studio and Java to create a mobile app for the game Minesweeper, inspired by Google's implementation. I created features like randomly placing mines, allowing users to flag cells, and implementing cell-revealing functionality. The app accurately reported game results and displayed the number of adjacent mines when a cell was revealed.
